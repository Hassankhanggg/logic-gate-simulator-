I just created an ic tester in c/c++ using arduinio with nokia lcd or you can use 16by2  i2c or any other.
Basically thir are two features of this ic tester
one is to search which ic is this
and second is which gate of this ic working and which not
basically i added 6 ic's in this code later on i will add some more ic to be tested 
those ic's that can be tested are given below
AND
NAND
XOR
OR
NOR
NOT
librarires i am using are
if you are using 16 by 2 lcd then you have to add LiquidCrystal.h
if you are using nokia 5110 lcd as i am using this then you have to add NOKIA_5110
if you are using 16by2 i2c then you have to use LiquidCrystal_I2C.h
the arduino i am using is mega 2560 you can use mega ADK but it expensive or you can use UNO which perfectly fit for htis project
you will need 24 male to female connecting wires
MOST IMPORTANT is that the simulator that i am using is PROTEUS PRODESSIONAL 8 and i sugest you as well
you can directly give the nokia lcd ground or vcc from arduino or just like me from pin giving high and low signal for vcc and ground respectively
