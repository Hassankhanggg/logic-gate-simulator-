finally i find out qpython which can b helpful for android......https://qr.ae/Tc5egG..........QPython: QPython is an on-device script engine and development environment that enables you to build native-like Android apps. Itâ€™s development toolkit to develop programs with mobile providing regular Python console.
PySide: PySide (the Python binding for the Qt toolkit) offers you LGPL-licensed Python binding for the Qt4, which includes a complete toolchain for rapidly generating bindings for any Qt-based C++ class hierarchy.
Termux: It is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment application that does not need rooting or any setup for working. A minimal base system is automatically installed, with additional packages available to be downloaded using the API package manager.
Beeware: Beeware is an open-source platform for creating enticing user interfaces and provides you with a complete package of libraries and support code that runs effectively on Android, iOS, tvOS, macOS, Linux, and more.
Kivy: Kivy is a OpenGL-based UI toolkit for cross-platform app development. It aids you to build native-like Android apps, utilize Android services, access Java APIs, and distribute them on different platforms, including Play Store.
However, I still suggest preferring native Android app development technologies and frameworks, like Java and Kotlin. This is so because regardless of the efforts you put into app development process, a Python-based Android app would never beat an Android app developed with native programming languages in terms of UI design, performance and compatibility to native device features. This implies, developing an app using Python might fail to entertain in the market and provide you with the desired outcomes.

In short, better to go with native Android mobile app development method
